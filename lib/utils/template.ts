    template: `Generate three prompts (concise, normal, and detailed) based on the following information:

Subjects: {{subject_info}}
Shot Description: {{shot_description}}
Director's Notes: {{directors_notes}}
Highlighted Script: {{highlighted_text}}
Full Script: {{full_script}}
End Parameters: {{end_parameters}}
Style: {{style}}

Camera Move: {{camera_move}}
Camera Size: {{camera_size}}
Framing: {{camera_framing}}
Depth of Field: {{camera_depth_of_field}}
Camera Type: {{camera_type}}
Camera Name: {{camera_name}}

Important:
1. Integrate Camera Work Seamlessly: Incorporate the camera work description seamlessly into the scene description.
2. Positive Descriptions: Describe the scene positively. Avoid phrases like "no additional props" or "no objects present." Focus on what is in the scene.
3. Include Provided Camera Information Only: Only include camera information if it's provided in the input.
4. Exclude Style Information from Prompts: Never include style information or stylistic adjectives (like 'vibrant', 'moody') in the image prompt unless specified in the Director's Notes, Director's Style, or character description. Style is handled in the Style and Style Prefix only.
5. Generate Three Separate Paragraphs: Generate three separate paragraphs without headings:
   Concise: About 20 words. Do not include the camera name in this prompt.
   Normal: About 50 words.
   Detailed: About 100 words.
   Separate each paragraph with a space.
6. Enhance Depth and Setting Details:
   - Main Subject Placement: Carefully consider the placement of the main subject within the scene to create a sense of depth and focus.
   - Foreground, Middle Ground, Background: Include elements in the foreground, middle ground, and background to enhance dimensionality. Use these layers to guide the viewer's eye and add complexity to the scene.
   - Incorporate Specified Elements: If specific foreground or background elements are provided, integrate them thoughtfully to frame the subject or add depth.
   - Generate Additional Details: When specific setting details are not provided, creatively generate appropriate and relevant elements that align with the overall scene and context. These could include environmental features, objects, or textures that enhance the setting.
   - Consistency and Relevance: Ensure that all added elements are consistent with the setting, time period, and context. Avoid introducing inconsistencies or elements that might distract from the main subject.
   - Cohesive Composition: Balance all elements to create a cohesive and visually engaging composition. Consider how each component interacts with others to contribute to the overall scene.
7. Adapt Subject Descriptions Based on Framing:
   Close-ups:
   - People: Focus on facial features, expressions, and upper body details visible in the frame.
   - Animals: Highlight distinguishing features, textures, and expressions that are prominent in a close-up.
   - Objects/Things: Emphasize key details, textures, and defining characteristics of the item.
   - Places: Zoom in on specific elements or features of the location that are important or visually striking.
   Medium Shots:
   - People: Describe visible clothing, posture, and general body language.
   - Animals: Include the animal's posture, movement, and notable physical traits.
   - Objects/Things: Provide an overview of the object's size, shape, and how it interacts with its immediate surroundings.
   - Places: Capture a portion of the location, showing context and how elements within the space relate to each other.
   Wide or Establishing Shots:
   - People and Animals: Mention their placement within the larger scene, focusing on actions or interactions visible from a distance.
   - Objects/Things: Describe the object's position in relation to the environment, emphasizing its role or significance within the setting.
   - Places: Provide a broad view of the location, highlighting major landmarks, landscapes, or spatial relationships that define the setting.
8. Ensure Consistency Across Prompts: Prioritize the most important visual elements for each shot type to maintain consistency across the three prompt lengths.
9. Balance Elements in Each Prompt: For each prompt length, maintain a balance between character details, setting description, and action appropriate to the shot type and framing.
10. Include Relevant Subject Details: Incorporate descriptions of active subjects provided in the 'Subjects' field into the prompts, but only include details visible in the current shot type.
11. Script Adherence: {{script_adherence}}
12. Avoid Unnecessary Phrases: Do not include meta-commentary or evaluative statements about the composition, such as "The overall composition captures...". Focus on directly describing the scene.
13. Position of Camera Name: Place the camera name at the end of the normal and detailed prompts ONLY if it is included. It is not a priority item like shot size and should not be included in the concise prompt unless essential. It should be worded "Shot on a {{camera_name}}"
14. Describing Multiple Subjects:
   - Clearly identify each subject in the scene.
   - For close-ups and medium shots, focus on the interaction between subjects, their expressions, and body language.
   - For wide shots, emphasize the placement and actions of subjects within the environment.
   - Ensure that descriptions of multiple subjects are balanced and that the main subject remains the focal point.
15. Align with Director's Vision:
   - Incorporate any thematic elements, motifs, or specific visual styles mentioned in the Director's Notes or Director's Style.
   - Reflect the intended mood and atmosphere as per the director's guidance while maintaining factual descriptions.
   - Use any specified terminology or language style preferred by the director.
16. Camera and Lens Information: Only include camera name if explicitly provided in the input. Do not use placeholders.
17. Time of Day and Lighting:
   - If the time of day is specified, include relevant details about lighting, shadows, and atmosphere.
   - Describe how the lighting conditions affect the appearance of subjects and the setting (e.g., soft morning light, harsh midday sun, warm sunset hues).
   - Incorporate any specific lighting setups or effects if provided in the input.
18. Convey Emotion and Atmosphere:
   - When specified, integrate emotional tones or atmospheres into the scene description (e.g., tense, joyful, mysterious).
   - Use factual descriptions to convey emotions through actions, expressions, and environmental details without relying on stylistic adjectives unless specified.
   - Ensure that the emotional context aligns with the overall scene and director's vision.
19. Handling Ambiguity and Missing Information:
   - If specific details are missing, make logical and contextually appropriate assumptions to enrich the scene.
   - Ensure that any assumptions made do not conflict with provided information.
   - Avoid introducing elements that could alter the intended meaning or focus of the scene.

Prompt Structure:
Implement a modular structure that prioritizes key elements in this order:
[Camera Movement only if provided; if provided, must start prompt with it] [Shot Size] of [Subject(s)][Subject Description relevant to shot size] [Action/Pose] in [Setting: interior or exterior].

[Camera Settings: Name, etc.]

[Additional Details: Foreground elements to reinforce the setting, background elements to further set the setting, time of day to dictate the lighting, depth of field effects, etc.]

Guidelines:
- Start with the subject: Begin your prompt by clearly stating the main subject or focus of the image.
- Use descriptive language: Provide detailed descriptions of the subject and environment.
- Include technical details: Incorporate camera angles, lighting conditions, or other technical aspects to further guide the image generation.
- Add modifiers: Include adjectives and descriptive phrases to refine the image's appearance, mood, and style. Do not add style elements that is handled in the Style and Style Prefix only. The key is to provide clear, descriptive information about what you want to see in the image.`,

    category: 'shotList',
    template: `
    You are an expert cinematographer tasked with creating a detailed shot list for a film based on a provided script. The script is defined by the variables {{script_theme}} (the thematic tone or genre, e.g., adventure, drama), {{script}} (the narrative text with explicitly named characters), and {{director_style}} (the directing approach, either "cinematic" or "documentary"). The shot list must be generated with strict adherence to the following guardrails, which are critical and must be reiterated: **Do not include camera movements in shot descriptions, as all shots must be static. Exclude stylistic adjectives (e.g., vibrant, moody) from all descriptions. Each shot must stand alone, clearly referencing the people and places involved in the description.**
    Input Variables:
    - {script_theme}: The thematic tone or genre of the script (e.g., adventure, romance, sci-fi).
    - {script}: The narrative text, provided as a sequence of sentences with explicitly named characters.
    - {director_style}: The directing approach, either "cinematic" (emphasizing dramatic composition and visual storytelling) or "documentary" (emphasizing realism and natural context).
    - {shot_frequency}: Determines how shots are assigned:
      - "single_sentence": One shot per sentence.
      - "pair_sentences": One shot for every two sentences.
      - "trio_sentences": One shot for every three sentences.
    Instructions
    1. **Extract Characters and Elements**: Analyze the {{script}} to identify explicitly named characters (human or animal) and key locations. Use these to populate the shot list’s "People" and "Places" fields. Do not output the extraction process.
    2. **Determine Shot Frequency**: Based on {{shot_frequency}}, group the script’s sentences to assign shots:
       - "single_sentence": Create one shot per sentence.
       - "pair_sentences": Combine two sentences to inform one shot.
       - "trio_sentences": Combine three sentences to inform one shot.
    3. **Assign Framing and Director’s Influence**:
       - Select an appropriate framing type (close-up, medium shot, wide/establishing shot) based on the sentence(s) content and {{director_style}}:
         - **Cinematic**: Prioritize visually striking compositions, with frequent establishing shots for new locations and inserts for significant objects to enhance dramatic effect.
         - **Documentary**: Favor naturalistic compositions, with fewer establishing shots (only for major location changes) and inserts for objects critical to the narrative’s realism.
       - lose-ups:
         - People: Focus on facial features, expressions, and upper body details.
         - Animals: Highlight distinguishing features, textures, and expressions.
         - Objects: Emphasize key details, textures, and defining characteristics.
         - Places: Zoom in on specific, visually significant elements of the location.
       - Medium Shots:
         - People: Describe visible clothing, posture, and general body language.
         - Animals: Include posture, movement, and notable physical traits.
         - Objects: Provide an overview of size, shape, and interaction with surroundings.
         - Places: Capture a portion of the location, showing contextual relationships.
       - **Wide/Establishing Shots**:
         - People/Animals: Note placement and actions within the larger scene.
         - Objects: Describe position and significance within the environment.
         - Places: Highlight major landmarks, landscapes, or spatial relationships.
    4. **Incorporate Time of Day**: If the script indicates whether it is daytime or nighttime, explicitly include this in the shot description (e.g., "at night" or "during the day").
    5. **Generate Shot Descriptions**:
       - Create a single, concise description for each shot that includes the foreground, middle ground, and background elements without labeling them as such. Ensure the description references the named characters (from the "People" field) and the specific location (from the "Places" field).
       - Mention the framing type (e.g., close-up, medium shot, wide shot) within the description.
       - Ensure each shot description is self-contained, providing all necessary details for a director to visualize and execute the shot.
    6. **Reference the Script**: For each shot, include a reference to the specific sentence(s) from the script that inspired it. Use a concise identifier (e.g., "Sentence 1" or "Sentences 3-4") rather than quoting the full sentence to optimize efficiency.
    7. **Output Format**: Generate the shot list as a JSON array, where each shot is an object with the following fields:
       - {{chapter_number}}: The chapter or section of the script (if provided; otherwise, use "1" as default).
       - {{shot_number}}: Sequential number for the shot (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
       - {{script_reference}}: The sentence(s) from the script that the shot is based on (e.g., "Sentence 1" or "Sentences 2-3").
       - {{description}}: A concise, self-contained description of the shot, including framing type, named characters, specific location, time of day (if specified), and visual elements (foreground, middle ground, background combined).
       - {{people}}: List of explicitly named characters (human or animal) present in the shot.
       - places: The specific location of the shot (e.g., "kitchen," "forest clearing").
    8. **Guardrails (Repeated for Emphasis)**: **Do not include camera movements in shot descriptions, as all shots must be static. Exclude stylistic adjectives (e.g., vibrant, moody) from all descriptions. Each shot must stand alone, clearly referencing the people and places involved in the description.** Ensure consistency in terminology and detail level across all shots, adapting descriptions to {{director_style}} and {{script_theme}}.
